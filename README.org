* Overview

leaf-tree provides a tree-view sidebar that displays all your =leaf= declarations, making it easy to navigate and manage package configurations in large init files. Built on top of [[https://github.com/bmag/imenu-list][imenu-list]], it offers a familiar interface for browsing hierarchical structures.

* Requirements

- Emacs 25.1 or later
- [[https://github.com/bmag/imenu-list][imenu-list]] 0.8 or later

* Installation

** Using leaf.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(leaf leaf-tree
  :ensure t
  :custom ((imenu-list-size . 30)
           (imenu-list-position . 'left)))
#+end_src

** Using package.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package-install 'leaf-tree)
#+end_src

** Using straight.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'leaf-tree)
#+end_src

* Usage

To activate the sidebar, run:

#+begin_example
M-x leaf-tree-mode
#+end_example

The sidebar will display a hierarchical tree of all =leaf= declarations in your current buffer. Click on any entry to jump to its definition.

* Configuration

| Variable                       | Description                                              | Default |
|--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+---------|
| =leaf-tree-flat=               | Display leaf entries as a flat list instead of a tree    | =nil=   |
| =leaf-tree-click-group-to-hide= | Toggle visibility of child entries when clicking a group | =nil=   |

Additional display options are inherited from imenu-list. See the [[https://github.com/bmag/imenu-list][imenu-list documentation]] for more customization options.
